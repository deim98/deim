            <h3>Altschool</h3>
            <p>Reasons why I joined Altschool was because I needed a program to guide me on my interest in pursuing digital health as a career. While studying medicine in the University, I've always wondered what career could bridge both my interest; which is Medicine and Technology. I made countless researches and luckily on a very good day on Twitter I saw the alt school . Prior to that, I had taken some minor courses on Coursera about python e.t.c and started learning on free code camp.I believe my Journey in Altschool would be a good one, although it's quite difficult juggling the medical career alongside with studying. </p>
